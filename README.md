## ✨ Features and Key Systems

- 🛤️ **Procedural Road Generation**: Prefabricated segments are randomly selected and positioned, with adjustments to rotation and position to create seamless transitions.
- 🤖 **Dynamic Obstacles with AI**: AI-driven vehicles are spawned in front of the player, and their movement and positions are dynamically managed.
- 🛑 **Brake Mechanic**: Players can slow down using the brake mechanic, visually represented by illuminated brake lights.
- 💥 **Collision Effects**: When a collision occurs, the game ends, and vehicles break apart using physics-based interactions for a realistic destruction effect.
- 🎮 **Simple Controls**: Use intuitive WSAD keys for movement and "R" to restart the game after a collision.
- 🎲 **Endless Replayability**: The road is procedurally generated, ensuring a unique experience every time.

## 🎮 How to Play
